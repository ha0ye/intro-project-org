## Description

This lesson introduces researchers to the concept of reproducibility,
souces of irreproducibility, and possible solutions. Instruction is
provided in organizational practices for files and folders during the
research process to enable researchers to: be more efficient,
collaborate more easily, and promote reproducibility. Attendees will
gain an understanding of the principles and practices in project
organization, file naming, and documenting their work.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

- describe sources of irreproducibility
- explain several solutions to improve reproducibility
- apply file and folder organization in research projects
- use and apply file naming conventions
- understand principles for documenting data and methods
